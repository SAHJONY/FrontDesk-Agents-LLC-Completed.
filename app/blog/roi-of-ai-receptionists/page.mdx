# The ROI of AI Receptionists: From Overhead to Profit Center

In the current economic climate, the traditional front-desk model is no longer a fixed cost—it is a financial leak. For a standard professional practice (Medical, Legal, or Property Management), the cost of a human receptionist exceeds **$4,500/month** when accounting for salary, benefits, and training.

## The Quantitative Shift

Our enterprise platform transforms this dynamic by deploying autonomous AI agents that operate at **4.4% of the cost** of traditional staffing.

| Metric | Human Receptionist | FrontDesk AI Agent |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Monthly Cost** | $4,500+ | $199 - $899 |
| **Availability** | 40 Hours/Week | 168 Hours/Week (24/7) |
| **Concurrent Calls** | 1 at a time | Unlimited Scaling |
| **Response Latency** | Variable | < 200ms Global Average |

## Beyond Cost: Capturing "After-Hours" Revenue

Statistically, **35% of high-value leads** call after 6:00 PM or during weekends. Without an autonomous agent, these leads represent lost revenue. FrontDesk Agents LLC ensures that every inbound inquiry is qualified and scheduled in real-time, effectively turning your front desk into a 24/7 profit center.

## Integration & Security

Our nodes are deployed globally on the **Vercel Edge Network**, utilizing **Upstash Redis** for sub-millisecond telemetry. This ensures that whether your client is in Portland or London, the interaction is indistinguishable from a local professional.
