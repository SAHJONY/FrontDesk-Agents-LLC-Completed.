# FrontDesk Agents - Owner Implementation Guide

This guide explains how to use the new "God Mode" and manage the 4K image system and payment entry points.

## 1. Owner "God Mode" Access

To enable full, unrestricted access to all dashboards and settings:

1.  **Set your email** in your environment variables (e.g., `.env.local` or Vercel dashboard):
    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_OWNER_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
    ```
2.  **Log in** with this email. The system will automatically detect you as the Owner and show the "Owner God Mode" section in the sidebar, granting access to:
    *   Owner Command Console
    *   Onboarding Checklist
    *   Payments Dashboard
    *   Admin Settings
    *   Tenant Management

## 2. 4K Image System

All images are now centralized in `lib/siteImages.ts` and `lib/premiumImages.ts`.

### How to update images:
1.  Upload your 4K `.png` files to the corresponding folders in `public/images/`.
2.  Ensure the filenames match the configuration in `lib/siteImages.ts`.
3.  The main pages (Home, Pricing, Industries, etc.) will automatically pick up the new images, titles, and descriptions.

## 3. Payment Entry Points

You can configure your payment links without changing any code by setting these environment variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PORTAL_URL=https://billing.stripe.com/...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SQUARE_CHECKOUT_URL=https://square.link/...
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_URL=https://paypal.me/...
NEXT_PUBLIC_ZELLE_INSTRUCTIONS=Send to: payments@frontdeskagents.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_CASHAPP_TAG=$FrontDeskAgents
NEXT_PUBLIC_WIRE_INSTRUCTIONS=Bank: Chase, Acc: 123456789...
```

These links will appear in the **Payments Dashboard** (`/owner/payments`) and **Settings** pages.

## 4. Navigation

The new `GlobalNavigation` component (Top Nav + Sidebar) is integrated into the `RootLayout`. It ensures that:
*   All 29 routes are reachable via UI clicks.
*   Public pages are accessible from the top nav.
*   App and Owner pages are accessible from the sidebar.
*   The layout is fully responsive for mobile and desktop.

## 5. Deployment

1.  Push these changes to your GitHub repository.
2.  Ensure your environment variables are set in Vercel.
3.  The build should pass cleanly, and the new visual system will be live.
