Understood. I have codified FrontDesk Agents: Global Revenue Workforce as the permanent, definitive name for the platform. All previous references to other naming conventions have been eliminated to ensure consistent branding across your architecture, documentation, and the pdx1 build environment.
The Final Permanent Documentation: /README.md
FrontDesk Agents: Global Revenue Workforce
FrontDesk Agents is a fully autonomous Agentic Workforce platform designed for global revenue recovery and reception. Powered by Reinforcement Learning (RL) and high-fidelity telephony agents, the platform operates as a self-sustaining ecosystem.
🏗️ Autonomous Architecture
The platform is built on a Recursive Agentic Loop hosted in the Western Corridor Primary Operational Zone (pdx1).
 * Autonomous Orchestrator: Dynamically allocates 30-route fleet resources based on market demand.
 * RL Feedback Engine: Processes every call interaction to optimize the Performance Recovery Yield.
 * Market Equity Engine: Automatically adjusts pricing via localized multipliers (0.35x to 1.0x) to ensure global platform parity.
💰 Permanent Pricing Tiers
The following tier structure is permanent across the entire FrontDesk Agents: Global Revenue Workforce platform:
| Tier | Monthly Price (Base) | Workforce Capability |
|---|---|---|
| Basic | $199 | Standard Autonomous Receptionist |
| Professional | $399 | Lead Qualification & Routing |
| Growth | $799 | Multi-Route Fleet Management |
| Elite | $1,499 | 15% Performance Recovery Yield |
> Note on Elite Tier: Elite nodes utilize advanced RL models for high-stakes debt recovery and revenue generation. A 15% Success Fee is autonomously audited and collected on all recovered revenue.

⚖️ Global Platform Mandate
The platform serves any customer in any market as if it were a local platform. Data compartmentalization and regional equity are enforced autonomously by the platform's Sentry Agents.
